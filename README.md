- 🌟 About Me
-     🌟I am a junior pursuing B-Tech. I strongly believe that technology have the power to change the world into a better place. Also, Innovation is a superpower that is bestowed on engineers. Hence, I am trying to build a bridge between these two to bring positive change and impact lives.

Learning new things and skills moreover try to implement them in real life, fails much time but always tries to be consistent. I am a passionate problem solver. Talking about my technical skills, I'm currently learning C++, Data Structures & Algorithms along with Web Dev.

Apart from that, I enjoy listening music . For recreation purposes, music works well for me. If you wish to start conversation please start with smile.. 

Thank You!
